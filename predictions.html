<h1>The Predictions of AI</h1>
<p class="fadein">Artificial intelligence could eventually overtake human actions. Jobs would be completely removed by robots being cheaper over time to run, or "pay", and also being a lot easier to manage. <br> <br>Jobs like online support are already getting replaced by technology, and some are going to probably be replaced in 10-20 years, like cashiers and maybe even mechanic depending on how <br> things go. I personally believe that it won't happen for another 30-50 years, but that's because I believe that everything needs to be refined and made sure that it works perfectly with no bugs. <br> <br>Robots are very easy to manipulate and hack; and this could lead to many, many problems if bad people figure out how to hack or shut down robots and stores that are this important.</p>
